# Azure AI/Fundamental AI Concepts

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/get-started-ai-fundamentals

* **Machine learning** - This is often the foundation for an AI system, and is the way we "teach" a computer model to make predictions and draw conclusions from data.
* **Computer vision** - Capabilities within AI to interpret the world visually through cameras, video, and images.
* **Natural language processing** - Capabilities within AI for a computer to interpret written or spoken language, and respond in kind.
* **Document intelligence** - Capabilities within AI that deal with managing, processing, and using high volumes of data found in forms and documents.
* **Knowledge mining** - Capabilities within AI to extract information from large volumes of often unstructured data to create a searchable knowledge store.
* **Generative AI** - Capabilities within AI that create original content in a variety of formats including natural language, image, code, and more.

### Machine learning in Microsoft Azure
Microsoft Azure provides the **Azure Machine Learning service** - a cloud-based platform for creating, managing, and publishing machine learning models. **Azure Machine Learning Studio** offers multiple authoring experiences such as:

* **Automated machine learning**: this feature enables non-experts to quickly create an effective machine learning model from data.
* **Azure Machine Learning designer**: a graphical interface enabling no-code development of machine learning solutions.
* **Data metric visualization**: analyze and optimize your experiments with visualization.
* **Notebooks**: write and run your own code in managed Jupyter Notebook servers that are directly integrated in the studio.

### Computer vision services in Microsoft Azure
You can use Microsoft's **Azure AI Vision** to develop computer vision solutions. The service features are available for use and testing in the **Azure Vision Studio** and other programming languages. Some features of Azure AI Vision include:

* **Image Analysis**: capabilities for analyzing images and video, and extracting descriptions, tags, objects, and text.
* **Face**: capabilities that enable you to build face detection and facial recognition solutions.
* **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: capabilities for extracting printed or handwritten text from images, enabling access to a digital version of the scanned text.

### Natural language processing in Microsoft Azure
You can use Microsoft's **Azure AI Language** to build natural language processing solutions. Some features of Azure AI Language include understanding and analyzing text, training conversational language models that can understand spoken or text-based commands, and building intelligent applications.

Microsoft's **Azure AI Speech** is another service that can be used to build natural language processing solutions. Azure AI Speech features include speech recognition and synthesis, real-time translations, conversation transcriptions, and more.

You can explore Azure AI Language features in the **Azure Language Studio** and Azure AI Speech features in the Azure Speech Studio. The service features are available for use and testing in the studios and other programming languages.

**Document Intelligence Studio** - extract text, tables, structures, key-values and named entities from documents. 

**Azure AI Search** - a form of Knowledge Mining. 

**Azure OpenAI service** - used to build Generative AI solutions. You can use the **Azure OpenAI Studio** user interface to manage, develop, and customize generative AI models.

### Challenges and Risk with AI

| Challenge or Risk	| Example|
| --- | --- |
| Bias can affect results	|A loan-approval model discriminates by gender due to bias in the data with which it was trained|
|Errors may cause harm	|An autonomous vehicle experiences a system failure and causes a collision|
|Data could be exposed	|A medical diagnostic bot is trained using sensitive patient data, which is stored insecurely|
|Solutions may not work for everyone	|A home automation assistant provides no audio output for visually impaired users|
|Users must trust a complex system|	An AI-based financial tool makes investment recommendations - what are they based on?|
|Who's liable for AI-driven decisions?	|An innocent person is convicted of a crime based on evidence from facial recognition â€“ who's responsible?|
