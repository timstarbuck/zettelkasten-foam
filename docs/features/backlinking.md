# Backlinking

When using [[wikilinks]], you can find all notes that link to a specific note in the **Connections Explorer**

- Run `Cmd` + `Shift` + `P` (`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` for Windows), type "connections" and run the **Explorer: Focus on Connections** view.
- Keep this pane always visible to discover relationships between your thoughts
- You can drag the connections panel to a different section in VS Code if you prefer. See: [[make-backlinks-more-prominent]]
- You can filter the connections to see just backlinks, forward links, or all connections
- Finding backlinks in published Foam workspaces via [[materialized-backlinks]] is on the [[roadmap]] but not yet implemented.
